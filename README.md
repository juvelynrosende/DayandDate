# DayandDate
User input day and date using switch statement
working 100%
Comments:
This code is a simple PHP script embedded within an HTML form that allows a user to input a number (1â€“7) and displays the corresponding day and date of the week using a switch statement. The HTML form includes a text input field and a submit button. When the user submits the form, the PHP script retrieves the input value using the $_GET superglobal. It then uses a switch statement to match the input number to a specific case (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, and so on), and outputs the corresponding day and date. The code ensures that the response dynamically changes based on the user's input.
